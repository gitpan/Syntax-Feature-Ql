NAME
    Syntax::Feature::Ql - Turns a quoted string into a single line

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
        use syntax qw( ql );

        # prints on one line
        say ql{
            Do you know the feeling when you want to generate a long
            string for a message without having to concatenate or end
            up with newlines and indentation?
        };

DESCRIPTION
    This is a syntax extension feature suitable for the syntax extension
    dispatcher.

    It provides two new quote-like operators named "ql" and "qql". These
    work in the same way as "q" and "qq" (including the ability to change
    the delimiters), except they put the returned string on a single line.

    The following all output "foo bar baz":

        # simple
        say ql{foo bar baz};

        # multiline
        say ql{
            foo
            bar
            baz
        };

        # different delimiters and interpolation
        my $qux = q{ # <- this is a normal quote!
            bar
            baz
        };
        say qql!
            foo
            $qux
        !;

    As you can see with the last example, interpolated values are also
    normalized to fit on the single line.

METHODS
  install
        Syntax::Feature::Ql->install( into => $target );

    Installs the "ql" and "qql" operators into the $target.
